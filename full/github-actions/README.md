## Pre-Learning

- [GitHub and GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)

## Prerequisites

This workshop will use GitHub for demonstrating the Hand-on part of the workshop. Make sure to have an active GitHub account and preferably get a GitHub Student's developer pack.

## What students will learn

This workshop primiralily focuses on GitHub Actions, but will start from absolute begining. We first introduce the audience about Git and it's purpose ##(this part is optional, you may ignore this part to reduce session length)##. Then we will move to GitHub and display basic functionality of GitHub. After demonstrating GitHub, we will introduce audience about DevOps Automation, why it is required and how they can make use of it in their projects. Now we'll move on to GitHub Actions and introduce different components of GitHub Workflow. 
Finally we'll end with a hands-on live coding part, where we will create a simple GitHub Workflow.

## Decide if serverless computing is right for your project

In this section, you will learn all about serverless computing and Azure Functions, and understand the benefits and drawbacks of a serverless compute solution. With this knowledge, you can [decide if serverless computing is right for your project](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/create-serverless-logic-with-azure-functions/2-decide-if-serverless-computing-is-right-for-your-business-need?WT.mc_id=academic-56400-ornella).

## Create a function app in the Azure portal

Once you have decided that a serverless solution would best fit your needs, the workshop will walk you through how to [create a function app in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/create-serverless-logic-with-azure-functions/3-create-an-azure-functions-app-in-the-azure-portal?WT.mc_id=academic-56400-ornella). You'll be able to choose if you want to code in JavaScript or PowerShell.

## Run your code on-demand with Azure Functions

Now that you have created a function app, you'll learn how to [build, configure, and execute a function](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/create-serverless-logic-with-azure-functions/4-creating-and-executing-an-azure-function?WT.mc_id=academic-56400-ornella). In this section, we also cover how to test your new Azure function.

## Add logic to the function app

Finally, we'll [add logic to the function app](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/create-serverless-logic-with-azure-functions/5-add-logic-to-the-function-app?WT.mc_id=academic-56400-ornella). For the purposes of this workshop, we will work with an example that checks for safe temperature levels.

## Quiz

[A simple quiz on GitHub Actions can be conducted to check knowledge and make the session interactive : )](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/create-serverless-logic-with-azure-functions/6-summary?WT.mc_id=academic-56400-ornella)

## Next steps

- [Execute an Azure Function with triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/execute-azure-function-with-triggers/?WT.mc_id=academic-56400-ornella)
- [Chain Azure Functions together using input and output bindings](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/chain-azure-functions-data-using-bindings/?WT.mc_id=academic-56400-ornella)
- [Develop, test, and publish Azure Functions by using Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/develop-test-deploy-azure-functions-with-core-tools/?WT.mc_id=academic-56400-ornella)

## Practice

Now that you know how to create Azure functions from the Azure portal, try creating one using your [Azure for Students subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/?WT.mc_id=academic-56400-ornella) and the [Azure Functions extension in Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)!
